    "date": " Jan 26, 2024 ",
    "description": "\nHello, I hope my message finds you well. My name is Nick Wolf, and I am searching for a virtual assistant to help me keep my life organized. I own and operate a holding company that manages multiple different businesses from SAAS to eCommerce to Lead Generation and Digital Marketing Agencies, service businesses, and even a sales organization.\n\nIf you're applying for this job, I think it's only fair to give you clear expectations for what you are walking into. So, what makes someone a perfect fit for this role?\n\n1) A go-getter :: I do not do well with people that don't have a motor to move fast. You should look for areas of improvement and create educated ideas/plans for how to improve those areas in the business. I will be looking to you to be my trusted right hand and advisor to ensure the success of our portfolio. I have a philosophy that I would rather be the hunter than the hunted - Hunters are go-getters. What are you doing every single day to get 1?tter than yesterday?\n\n2) Reliable :: I need someone that I can tell something once and consider it done. I want you to be reliable as the speed of light. If I send a message, it's responded to in a timely manner (as long as it's within working hours - I want you to have a good life outside of work too haha).\n\n3) Great Personality :: I take pride in taking care of the people that I work with. If you're sitting at my table, you're going to eat. I have a principle that I do business with people that I want to do life with. Are you fun to talk to? What are your hobbies? Can you carry a conversation? You will be representing me sometimes in situations to my business partners, my other employees, and our company operators. It's important that they like you too.\n\n4) Experience :: Be a Swiss Army knife - someone that can do everything. I want you to be able to speak the same language as me and help take the admin workload off of my plate. I primarily operate in Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Klaviyo, Shopify, Slack (Communication), ClickUp (Project Management), WordPress, Google Suite, Miro, Figma, Zapier, Notion, Yelp, Google My Business, SEO, Google LSA, etc. \u2013 The question I will be asking a lot is how can I give more responsibilities over to you...\n\n5) Attention To Detail & Organization :: Listen I know my strengths and I know my weaknesses. My biggest weakness is organization. Your job will be to keep us on track. My to-do list is always 50 things minimum so keep us on the right path and help me prioritize the most important items that I need to do daily. You will always be my second pair of eyes so nothing falls through the cracks. And just so I know for sure that you read this entire job description - If you're interested, I want you to add the words \"Marty Byrde\" at the top and in the subject of your application for this role.\n\n6) Clear, Concise Communication :: I get it. Some projects/tasks will take longer than expected. Totally fine! But it MUST be communicated with me - I do not want to have to reach out asking for updates. I want frequent status updates (the minimum is daily status reports). It's essential I know what is going on with my companies at all times to be able to make quick decisions.\n\n7) Trustworthy :: This is the easiest one. Have integrity - Do the right thing even when no one is looking. I have zero patience for people that I cannot trust.\n\n8) Resourceful :: Google & ChatGPT exist. If you don't have a pro GPT account, get one or I will buy you one! I categorize questions into 5 cent, 25 cent, and $1 questions ... Do not spend time on things that can be Googled or found on ChatGPT. Let's spend our time together on the $1 questions - the big items that have the highest leverage for returns.\n\n9) Problem Solver :: It's easy to constantly bring up problems or areas that need improvement. We're growing companies, so we will always have weak areas that need improvement. To go to the next level, I need you to be a problem solver. I'd rather have to pull you back than constantly have to push you forward. Don't just bring me problems but help me solve them!\n\n10) Have fun :: It's mandatory! Business is not worth it if you're not having fun! We'll have a great time together.\n\nIf you're still reading, think your values align with mine and are still interested, I applaud you, and you're probably someone that I want to talk to for this role!\n\nYour English must be fluent - both verbal and written.\n\nDaily tasks will vary but can include things like:\n\u2013 Email & Slack Management\n\u2013 Ad Management & Campaign Launching\n\u2013 Building Automations & Workflows In Zapier & GoHighLevel\n\u2013 Client & Partner Communication\n\u2013 Daily Reports & Status Updates\n\u2013 Client Communication\n\u2013 Social Media Management\n\u2013 Tracking & Reporting Results\n\u2013 Project management\n\u2013 Maintaining A Standard Of Excellence\n\u2013 Task Management\n\u2013 Note Taking & Summaries\n\nI only hire the best of the best. A+ players that want to grow.\n\nThis is a full time position, but you will only be expected to be online for communication from 7am - 1pm Central Time. When you get work done outside of that is up to you! Salary will be paid out on the 1st and 15th of every month. \n\nWith your application send me a selfie video of yourself introducing yourself and talking about your experience plus something you\u2019re passionate about. Let me know what questions that you have for me! Send me your application and let's talk! ",

This will be a long term part time or full time position since I will need your help to make adjustments to the bot as needed.\n\nI will be using this bot for my own personal purposes but I also want to be able to sell the bot as a paid monthly service so that other TikTok Shop Owners can use it as well.\n\nThis position is ideal for someone that has very strong knowledge of software development. In a perfect world - I would like the bot to be able to offer some sort of personalization so that the TikTok user thinks its a unique message and that we are not mass messaging them. This might be possible to do with Chatgpt...but I'm not sure. If you have knowledge on how we can incorporate Chatgpt or AI into this bot to offer personalization then that would be a very big advantage for you. If you have an idea of how we can offer personalization into the messaging then please be sure to mention that in the message you write to me.\n\n\nHere are the list of features that I want the bot to have:\n\n- It needs to be able to select the filters that I want and send a pre written message one by one to the TikTok user that appear in the search results.\n\n- It needs to be able to send a pre written follow up message to TikTok users that did NOT reply to the initial message that the bot sent out.\n\n- It needs to be able to skip a TikTok users profile if the software has already messaged them (Is this possible to do?)\n\n- If the TikTok user has an email address in the bio then I would like to have the bot collect the email address and store it separately in an excel file (Is this possible to do?)\n\n\n\n\nPlease reply back with your answers to these questions:\n\n1. Have you created an automation bot before in the past? If so, can you please provide me with a link to the bot you created or a description of the bots features that you have created?\n\n2. The bot needs to mimc human behavior so that it avoids detection from TikTok. It will need to have a random timer in between messages that it sends out. Do you have any other suggestions as to what else we can implement to avoid detection by TikTok?\n\n3. What is your desired hourly pay? \n\n4. What is the rough total cost for this project to be completed?\n\n5. How long will it take you to create this bot?\n\n6. Should this bot be web based, a desktop app that the customer downloads, chrome extension\u2026etc? What do you recommend and why do you recommend that?\n\n7. Do you use TikTok Shops or TikTok?\n\n8. Could this software be created using \u201cNo Code Software\u201d like Upgrade to see actual info ?\n\n\n\nHere are a few competitors that are selling a TikTok Shop messaging automation bot.

    "description": "\nI am looking to have a data-centric website developed. More information will be provided upon acceptance of the contract. However this is the tech stack:\nTechnology Stack:\n- AppWrite (primarily user authentication)\n- MongoDB\n- PostgreSQL\n- NGINX & Ubuntu (as the web server)\nCode Implementation:\n- Utilizing NextJS for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) preferably TypeScript but JavaScript is fine\nPayment Processing:\n- Integration with Paddle.com\nUI/UX:\nCharts - Echarts\nUI - Shadcn\nNewsletter Management:\n- Ghost.org\nDocumentation:\n- Utilizing markdoc.dev\nThis is not your typical website; it's a project of considerable complexity due to it being a data-focused website. I have a VERY rough sketch of the website, but the developer who takes on this project will need an entrepreneurial mindset to read the Miro Mindmap and then develop the features. I want to make this very clear, the mindmap (Miro.com) will be the primary source of direction. While I will provide rough sketches on Figma, screenshots, and similar/competitor websites for ideas, the miro mindmap should be considered the core guidance, with everything else supplemental. I have thorough github issues listing the features and what they entail, as well as github discussions to explain functionality, but you will need the abilty to understand the feature, then design it, and then implement the code. While UI/UX design isn't the primary focus, the ability to develop a website without wireframes or Figma designs is crucial. Candidates with UX design skills will be prioritized, as it eliminates the need for a separate UX designer later on. The pay will reflect the added skillset. The website will need to be viewed on mobile and desktop.\nThe website primarily focuses on data representation, featuring numerous tables and charts. User authentication is managed through a self-hosted installation of AppWrite (that you will setup on the server provided), with data sourced dynamically from MongoDB and PostgreSQL for charts and tables using AppWrite Functions. Therefore, comfort with data manipulation and display is essential.\nData collection is automated through scripts, leaving the primary task of the developer to focus on data presentation from the databases. The website will be employing many/all strategies to prevent scraping. You will also need to be familiar with anti-scraping techniques, and server-side-rendering. I don't want people to be able to 'inspect elements' and then be able to extract data.\nThis contract pertains to the initial version of the website, with opportunities for future engagements involving feature enhancements, maintenance, and more.\nDue to the project's complexity, we expect inquiries to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements outlined herein. We prioritize candidates who can comprehend the full scope of the project and its intricacies. Your proposal should thoroughly understand the scope of this project, and show it. Answering one word answers to questions, or using ChatGPT will not suffice.\nFinal Deliverables:\n1. Code repository uploaded to GitHub (provided post-contract acceptance)\n2. Design & implementation of code on the server (credentials provided post-contract acceptance)\n3. Website launch and thorough testing to ensure seamless functionality.\n## this will be contracted through UpWork ",

Tough clients, unpredictable workload, unclear & incomplete step-to-step instructions, mix of monotonous & really challenging jobs, creative approach, constant learning, additional responsibility at times, calculative and diligent decisions in the absence of your manager. Training will be provided, however expect the training phase to be stressful. Do NOT apply if you can\u2019t handle pressure. \n\u2018Guaranteed recognition and appreciation\u2019 in case of excellent feedback from manager and director.\n\nIf you pride yourself on being an Excel or spreadsheet pro, a whiz at formulas, love creating data workflows, and thrive on decoding the meaning behind data, and if you see yourself as a 'go-getter'\u2014this is the role for you!
