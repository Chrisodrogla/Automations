I will be reviewing your code and giving feedback. Note that I only work part time at this business.\n\nThe specific programming languages and technologies you are familiar with do not matter, you can learn other languages, however knowing these are beneficial:\n\n(in no particular order)\n(I don't use all of these, I just want to know if you know them)\n\n- C#\n- F#\n- WPF\n- Java\n- OCaml\n- Python 3\n- Golang\n- Rust\n- Docker\n- Kubernetes\n- Azure\n- AWS\n- SQL (which dialect?)\n- NoSQL systems (which?)\n- TypeScript\n- React\n- Redis\n- Kafka\n- Terraform\n- ChatGPT including its API, or similar\n- PyTorch\n- TensorFlow\n- Selenium\n\nAn understanding of the following is beneficial but absolutely not necessary, mention to me what you know about these:\n- Economics\n- Finance\n- Trading (stocks or otherwise)\n- Politics\n- Geopolitics\n- Prediction Markets\n- Psychology\n- Statistics\n- Calculus\n\nThis is a very early-stage business.

Due to the nature of the business, even building an MVP will take some time.\n\nThe project involves creating an analytics system for geopolitical analysis. The purpose of the analysis is to license it to financial firms to help them understand risk to their financial assets. The analysis uses OS INT techniques but the idea is to automate a significant chunk of the analysis, so that we can cover much more material with a small number of human analysts. It is a cloud-based system, using microservice architecture. ",

    "description": "\nThere are two areas I need expertise in. I have to build 8 new websites for products I have rights to distribute and sell. My servers run on Virtualmin and I have a part-time admin to help with server management. This requires starting from zero to fully functioning marketing websites. Some sites are very simple with one item to market (an airplane, for example) and the focus would be soliciting clients to request data and purchase. Other sites will be a product line of items for specific vendors. Some are inventories, some are dropped from the factory.\n\nThe new websites you will design and quickly implement will focus on aircraft and aviation products that I am involved with and parts connected with aircraft and aviation. I need a skilled WP/Elementor designer to help design, build, populate and update as the sites grow. The sites need to follow the vendor's guidelines for style, imagery, font and other guidelines. I will provide the marketing components while you design the site and operational details. We will need to collaborate up front and you will be expected to guide the project and I will help with any problems or decisions you have to make.\n\nClients need to be able to order, request quotes and pay. But many of these items are high value so credit cards are not the solution. Most clients use wires, ACH, checks and other cash-like transfers to avoid fees. Many items are high-priced, low volume so tracking leads and advertising are critical to reach the customers. \n\nYou should be able to improve my ability to deliver client quotes, obtain customer feedback, submit support inquiries and assist connecting with a CRM so we can track our leads and customers. Many of the products can be shared across multiple websites so catalog product management experience would be helpful but not required. A major part of the sales pitch is imagery and graphics designed to sell specific aircraft and aircraft-related products. I also have imagery from a major vendor and rights to sell products that need a professional dealer website, fast response to monthly product and price changes and ability for customers to interact, ask questions, get quotes, design and order different combinations of products, track inventory and more. I am doing that manually at this time so you have a chance to improve both our lives.\n\nI am based in Canada and most clients will be in North America and to a lesser extent Australia and Europe. Shipping and receiving is a major piece of my business that is growing. Some items are drop shipped. I have not explored any sales on ebay, Amazon and the products do not seem suited to social media marketing but I do advertise there to obtain mostly to funnel members to my websites.\n\nA secondary project is moving my 10-year community phpbb site to latest version (3.3). PHP/Mysql would be beneficial but not essential. I will need assistance to migrate special mods to the new \"extension\" methods. Skills in this area would be helpful but not required for the primary sites above.\n\nThis position has some immediate requirements for the right person and long-term employment potential. I run a very small team and I am very involved in the details but need to expand these new product lines and continue to upgrade the site that I currently maintain. A probationary period would be expected so we can see if we can work long-term together as a team. Salary is negotiable and tied to skills you have. ",

    "description": "\nCMS expert with strong Canva design skills\n\nWe are a small but growing company who manages the design and deployment of video based content to be displayed on digital signage in schools across Ireland so we work in GMT time zone. Our site is www.schooltvpro.com \n\nContent is designed on Canva and deployed remotely to a CMS system. We actually use 3 different CMS which are similar. Experience in using a CMS is important. \n?https://youtu.be/_EkK942BdKQ is a quick explainer. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_DgpDOy8U4&ab_channel=CiaranCronin shows what teachers see. \n\nI\u2019m looking for someone to manage this system. The right candidate has extensive knowledge in operating and using a CMS as well as has great experience in using Canva. \nWe are facing into year 3 right now. My last VA is leaving as she has found a full time job in Education. \n\nOnce you\u2019re up and running it\u2019s the same thing every week so not a difficult job. \nYou get regular, weekly work and pay cheque. Some weeks are quieter than others. \n\nCMS\nThe 3 different CMS is quite simple and rudimentary. Schools are listed on the CMS. If there is a connection it shows as green, if there is an issue it shows in red. Wherein there will be an onboarding process, I expect that your CMS experience will shine through and you will quickly get up to speed on how content is scheduled and deployed on the system. \n\nOnboarding\nMy previous VA has written up a detailed doc outlining her role and everything that she did in the role so you will have this doc. Equally, she has agreed to do one onboarding session with you over google meet / zoom to finalise the onboarding and get you up to speed on everything. \nThe working week\nYou are contracted for 20 hours per week. \n\nCommunication is on Slack. You clock in and out this way as well as using timedoctor. \nEvery Tuesday and Wednesdy reminders are sent to schools to have their content in by the Wednesday. Most schools will comply and some will be late which we tolerate on a case by case. Generally most schools comply and have their content requests submitted by the WEdneday via a shared google sheets system. It\u2019s all very straight forward. \n\nCanva / Design\nYou must be very good and experienced in using Canva and have an ability to produce high quality work. This part isn\u2019t rocket science. You need to show good design flair knowing that content approach needs to change from week to week to keep things interesting. WE take a \u2018video first\u2019 approach which is to say that content is to be in some sense dynamic and not appear like a \u2018powerpoint\u2019. I have many examples of content that I can share with you which I feel will help greatly. \n\nOther skills\nYou must be good with google sheets, google docs, email etc. \n\nAccuracy\nYour English needs to be good. This is content that will display to teachers so accuracy around dates, spelling, language etc needs to be good. In most cases the text is already there and I am here to help. \nAccountability\nThis will be done using time doctor. \n\nPay\nRate of pay for first 6 months is $4 p/h. After review rising to $4.50 p/h. As more schools come on board, we can review hours upwards as needed. This means I am looking for a top quality, dedicated candidate. \n\nHaving another job\nI understand that this is not a full time job. So once I know and understand what an existing job looks like for you and that it fits with this role I shouldn\u2019t have an issue. As long as you are online when you should be, contactable and doing the work on time and accurately etc I will be happy with this. We can talk this out over interview. I expect honesty here. \nOnboarding new schools\nAS we get into the year, we will be onboarding new schools. There will be some set up work here eg with the google sheets etc but this is easily counted in the hours as it\u2019s not a big task. \n\nTreatment and respect\nI am a very fair manager. You can ask this with the previous VA if you get to onboarding stage. I will treat you with the utmost respect. In another business I run, I have a VA for 5 years and know what it means to be respectful on my side. I believe you will see this at interview stage. I ask that you are open and communicative.\nWhat I am not looking for\nSomeone who has multiple other jobs and cannot commit to this\nSomeone who has a history of turning up late, absent\nSomeone who lies about experience\nSomeone who is resilient. Some weeks will be very busy, some will be quiet. I need someone who can work hard when it\u2019s needed and can deal with different situations as they arise. \nBackground checks\nI will conduct background checks. Having employed many VA\u2019s in the past, I have seen how valuable this is. Be prepared that I will contact previous employers etc. I will expect to have the correct contact details of this person eg I expect that they will have a business email. Equally, please do not include a colleague as a reference, it would need to be a line manager, boss, Principal etc. \n\nIf you feel you are the right person let\u2019s talk!\nIf you have no CMS experience please do not apply.

We lived on a little pond, which was directly in our backyard. On the other side of the pond was a little town park. Our neighbors were a bit spaced out. It was a pretty upscale, expensive block compared to the rest of the town, so the properties were big. I'm fully moved out now, but this was back when I was in college. My parents make a lot of money, and we have multiple homes, so often I was home alone.\n\nIt was a random night in the summertime. I was off from school, so I can't remember if it was the weekend or a weekday, but odds are since I was home, it was a random weekday. I was in the back sunroom watching a show. That was my favorite room in the house in the summer because it was the most cozy and had the best breeze with all the windows open. I was right on the corner of the couch, closest to the corner window, when I heard splashing from outside, like in the pond. It could have been a goose or duck; sometimes they'd fight in the water and make a bunch of splashing sounds, so at first, I ignored it. But as it persisted, I decided to lower the volume on the TV and listen. I put my ear up to the window even and heard consistent splashing sounds, way too heavy to be from a duck or goose. It sounded like they were splashes from a person. ",
