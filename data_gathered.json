    "description": "\nI want to automate writing with ChatGPT, I know there are platforms that do this but my prompts are better and give me better outcomes. I need a program that will allow me to create content without having to continually prompt. Here is what I think I'm looking for. I would need to be able to input fields, have it flow to the program, have the program create the content and have it saved or posted.. \n\nFrom ChatGPT:\n\nCreating an automated program to handle content creation tasks without manual prompting each time involves setting up a script or software that interacts with a text-based interface like an API (Application Programming Interface). Given the specific context of using tools like OpenAI's GPT models (like this one, ChatGPT), you would typically develop a script that sends prompts automatically and handles responses for further processing.\n\nHere\u2019s a simplified step-by-step guide to set up such a program using Python, one of the most accessible and widely used programming languages for such tasks:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Python Environment\n\nEnsure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [Upgrade to see actual info](Upgrade to see actual info). Additionally, you'll need `pip` to install packages. Most Python installations come with `pip`.\n\n### Step 2: Install Required Packages\n\nYou will need the `openai` Python package to interact with the OpenAI API. Install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install openai\n```\n\n### Step 3: Obtain API Credentials\n\nTo use OpenAI\u2019s API, you need an API key, which you can get from [OpenAI's API platform](Upgrade to see actual info). Keep this key secure and do not share it with others.\n\n### Step 4: Write the Automation Script\n\nHere\u2019s a basic Python script that automates sending prompts to the GPT model and retrieving responses:\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Replace 'your-api-key' with your actual OpenAI API key\nopenai.api_key = 'your-api-key'\n\ndef send_prompt(prompt):\ntry:\nresponse = Upgrade to see actual infopletion.create(\nengine=\"text-davinci-002\", # or whatever the latest model is\nprompt=prompt,\nmax_tokens=150\n)\nreturn Upgrade to see actual infooices[0].text.strip()\nexcept Exception as e:\nreturn str(e)\n\n# Example usage\nchapter_titles = [\n\"Understanding the Basics of Real Estate\",\n\"Getting Started in House Flipping\",\n\"Financing Your Flip\",\n\"The Flipping Process\",\n\"Sales and Marketing\",\n\"Advanced Strategies and Scaling Up\"\n]\n\nfor title in chapter_titles:\nprompt = f\"Write an introductory section for a chapter titled '{title}' that explains key concepts and prepares the reader for detailed learning.\"\nprint(f\"Chapter: {title}\")\nprint(send_prompt(prompt))\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"-\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n```\n\n### Step 5: Schedule the Script\n\nIf you want this script to run automatically at certain times (e.g., once a day), you can use scheduling tools such as:\n- **Cron Jobs** (Linux/Mac): For setting up scripts to run at scheduled times.\n- **Task Scheduler** (Windows): For scheduling tasks to be executed automatically at predefined times.\n\n### Step 6: Handling Output\n\nThe script outputs responses directly to the console. For a more sophisticated approach:\n- Write responses to a file.\n- Send notifications or emails with the content.\n- Integrate with webhooks to post content directly to CMS or blogs.\n\n### Step 7: Monitor and Maintain\n\nKeep an eye on the performance and outputs of your script, especially looking out for:\n- API errors or changes.\n- Updates in API models or parameters.\n- Security of your API key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up a basic automated content creation tool using OpenAI's API. This setup can be expanded with more complex logic, integration with other tools, or even developing a web-based interface for managing these tasks. Remember to comply with OpenAI's use case policies and handle your API key securely. ",

This is why we only work with clients who serve people. From firefighters, to law firms, to suppliers sending life-saving food to kids dying of malnutrition, the work you do will help make the world a better place.\n\nOur team is made up of people who want to do the best work of their life. People who love to learn, challenge themselves, grow and have some fun along the way. We also care about each other \u2013 we support each other in our own personal goals and vision. We are human beings before employees and we love to bring out the best in each other. \n\nNow, ready to learn more about this opening? Buckle up.\n\nIf you work here, you\u2019ll be: \n- Challenged to do the best work of your life in a supportive environment.\n- Become the best communicator you can become (this is the most important thing we do).\n- Have the space to ask questions, voice your feedback and make a difference (and be yourself).\n- Help expand our server infrastructure, tools and grow with your fellow developers. \n\nYou\u2019ll do well in this job if you:\n- Have a strong background in Ubuntu and managing services like Nginx, Postgres, Redis, etc.\n- Able to identify bottlenecks and make suggestions on where we can improve.\n- Familiar with high traffic systems where we want the least amount of downtime.\n- Know enough to be dangerous in Python (but not an expert) and familiar with how APIs work. \n- Willing to help us understand our app and troubleshoot (eg. digging in the database, checking server logs, etc)\n- Understand DNS, able to open web inspector and analyze XHR requests, etc.\n- Enjoy working with people who actually care about what they do and will not let you be lazy or do sloppy work.\n- Have an opinion and care about best practices and love learning and creating and building. \n- Have grit and determination and are someone who will exceed no matter what gets in your way.\n- Are attentive to detail. (I will hold you accountable to this)\n\nYou probably shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n- You\u2019re \u201cjust looking for extra money.\u201d\n- You like working 5 full-time jobs because all you care about is work. \n- You get offended easily and take things personally. \n- You are not someone with grit and determination who can persevere while being challenged to do great work.\n- You get overwhelmed easily with problems, new habits, new learnings and chat messages. \n\nThe interview process:\n- Since 99% of our work is done via Slack (we don\u2019t do scheduled calls), the entire interview process will be via email. (With lots of questions, sprinkled with a few voice notes)\n- Note: this is the first time we're hiring for a Linux admin role. You have freedom to help carve this path out for yourself. \n\nIf you work here:\n- You\u2019ll get 13th month salary, Filipino holidays, unlimited time off (we don\u2019t count sick days), a normal working day schedule (no night shifts, although an early start is preferred for time overlap) with some flexibility, 2 weeks off during the holidays in December, and the opportunity to grow and become your best self. \n\nA little more about us:\n- We\u2019ve been in business for nearly a decade. Our whole family (some companies call this \u201ctheir employees\u201d) are remote (mostly in the Philippines). Our longest standing family member has been with us for over 12+ years. Another one of our developers used to be an accountant. We all love what we do. \n\nHow to begin\n- Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to send us an email with 3 questions you have about this role. If you\u2019re currently in a full-time role and are looking for something new, we\u2019re open to a transition window. We actually care about your happiness. ",

Please read the entire job description before replying to this or submitting a cover letter.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWe are looking to hire at least 4 at least amazing teaUpgrade to see actual infombers. Each of the applicants / hires will work directly with a vacation rentals owner / host. The average portfolio size is 15. \n\nAs far as your pay scale goes, we will be happy to negotiate based on your prior experience and performance in the future. We plan on giving raises to the right person if they provide what we are looking for.\n\nWe already have a lot of automation in place. We use Ownerrez, Hospitable, Pricelabs, Rankbreeze as well as other systems. We have our listings on Airbnb, Vrbo as well as our direct booking site. We will provide a base set of resources, data, and scripts that can be built on over time. We have a mastermind of other experienced Virtual Assistants who work with other investors we know. You will be able to work with the other virtual assistants in order to find best practices to stay ahead of our competitors in this ever-changing business. Our goal for our team of VAs is to have a well-trained group who learn together, constantly adjust to this business, can think critically, and \u201clead up.\u201d\n\nQualifications include:\n1) Experience working FOR Airbnb with specific knowledge of how to constantly improve SEO of our listings and complaint resolution\n2) Attention to detail\n3) Graphic Design / Video Editing (Canva, etc) \u2013 This is not a requirement but would be preferred\n4) Self-starter with initiative while also able to perform within a team situation in order to move our business forward\n5) Great communication skills \u2013 we text with each other daily. We expect you to be able to at the very least text and email with guests and contractors. Being comfortable speaking English over the phone is also valuable\n6) Each position to be hired will require specific hours. The goal is to cover the busiest times of the day for our business.\n7) Reliable Internet\n\nTasks include (but aren't limited to):\n1. SEO and backlinking to increase bookings - SEO, within Airbnb and VRBO, are very important to us.\n2. Complaint Resolution - When there are complaints filed by guests, or we need to file a damage claim, we would expect you could handle this.\n3. Helping make our systems run better \u2013 We use Airtable, spreadsheets, Whatsapp among other systems.\n4. Managing turns (cleaners cleaning the property) at each checkout. This should be automated, but will just need monitoring within the systems I have in place.\n5. Respond to guest messages - a daily task - for initial inquiries, respond within the hour (or upon waking if the message was sent overnight) - We will work with you as it relates to automated messages within our system we already have in place.\n6. Putting a list of areas of improvement together (based on guests' reviews) and sending it to relevant parties (usually to myself and the cleaners) with actionable suggestions.\n7. Ordering any supplies that need to be refilled and ensuring they are sourced from cost-effective but well-made suppliers. This task can and will change over time. There may be repetitive orders like hot tub filters. We will have pre-set suppliers identified. There will also be emergent orders. For instance, we just ordered garbage bags, and our guests said the garbage bags did not fit the garbage cans. We ordered one box of garbage bags on Instacart. The guest was happy and we didn\u2019t have to bother our cleaners for an unnecessary and expensive trip.\n8. Organizing maintenance and repairs with our preferred list of contractors.\n9. Help our social media profile for all of our listings.\n10. If you dUpgrade to see actual info to apply for this job, you\u2019ll need to add something to the title of your email to make it past the first step.

The ads manager would need to learn how to search for our target audience, use FB pixels and actually create the content being advertised.\n12. This business relationship must be built on trust. Our goal is to prove to you that we are trustworthy. I\u2019d like to provide an opportunity for you to earn enough income to live on and be home for your family if that is your goal. I\u2019d also eventually like to give you the autonomy to make decisions and be part of this team, not simply an employee taking orders.\n13. Utilize a task management system such as Monday.\n\nGOALS\n\nOur main goal is to build and grow for the long haul. We are in this business for the next several decades. We hope to find a team of Virtual Assistants who will be willing to work with us for years to come.\nWithin 15 days, our expectation is that you are able to respond to simple guest inquiries regarding their stay. This could include tasks such as questions about amenities, booking-related questions, etc. We expect you will be able to understand our systems and complete some administrative tasks such as logging a guest complaint using our simple form and adjusting a booking. We expect you will be able to help track and constantly improve our rankings on Airbnb.\n\nPlease describe any knowledge or experience you have with the short-term rental business model. More specifically, please describe any knowledge or experience you have with any systems that work well with the short-term rental business model.\n\nThank you for looking! ",

    "description": "\nAre you passionate about Python and becoming the best developer you can become? Let\u2019s team up. \n\nWe believe in people. This is why we only work with clients who serve people. From firefighters, to law firms, to suppliers sending life-saving food to kids dying of malnutrition, the code you write will help make the world a better place.\n\nOur team is made up of people who want to do the best work of their life. People who love to learn, challenge themselves, grow and have some fun along the journey. We also care about each other \u2013 we support each other in our own personal goals and vision. We are human beings before employees and we love to bring out the best in each other. \n\nNow, ready to learn more about this opening? Buckle up.\n\nIf you work here, you\u2019ll be: \n- Challenged to do the best work of your life in a supportive environment.\n- Become the best communicator you can become (this is the most important thing we do).\n- Have the space to ask questions, voice your feedback and make a difference (and be yourself).\n- Help expand our codebase and tools, participate in code reviews, and grow with your fellow developers. \n\nYou\u2019ll do well in this job if you:\n- Have a strong background in Python and understand HTML, CSS and Javascript enough to be dangerous.\n- Enjoy working with people who actually care about what they do and will not let you be lazy or do sloppy work.\n- Have an opinion and care about best practices and love learning and creating and building. \n- Are familiar with common things we deal with as developers: Git, SQLAlchemy, building and engaging with APIs, linters, etc. \n- Have grit and determination and are someone who will exceed no matter what gets in your way.\n- Are attentive to detail. (I will hold you accountable to this)\n\nYou probably shouldn\u2019t apply if:\n- You\u2019re \u201cjust looking for extra money.\u201d\n- You like working 5 full-time jobs because all you care about is work. \n- You get offended easily and take things personally. \n- You are not someone with grit and determination who can persevere while being challenged to do great work.\n- You get overwhelmed easily with new code, new habits, new learnings and chat messages. \n\nThe interview process:\n- Since 99% of our work is done via Slack (we don\u2019t do scheduled calls), the entire interview process will be via email. (With lots of questions, sprinkled with a few voice notes)\n- You may be able to speak with a developer or two on our team to see how they like the role. \n\nIf you work here:\n- You\u2019ll get 13th month salary, Filipino holidays, unlimited time off (we don\u2019t count sick days), a normal working day schedule (no night shifts, although an early start is preferred for time overlap) with some flexibility, 2 weeks off during the holidays in December, and the opportunity to grow and become your best self. \n\nA little more about us:\n- We\u2019ve been in business for nearly a decade. Our whole family (some companies call this \u201ctheir employees\u201d) are remote (mostly in the Philippines). Our longest standing family member has been with us for over 11+ years. One of our developers has a family of 5 (and quit smoking with our support, we threw a pizza party for him). Another one of our developers used to be an accountant. We all love what we do. \n\nHow to begin\n- Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to send us an email with 3 questions you have about this role. If you\u2019re currently in a full-time role and are looking for something new, we\u2019re open to a transition window. We actually care about your happiness.\n\nNOTE: While we like AI, and we use it in certain circumstances, I can almost guarantee that using AI generated emails to me will not help you. Communication is the most important thing we do. If I don't see your natural voice from our first interaction, then you're setting an inaccurate representation of who you are and how you communicate. And when I see that change, it's going to come across as a lack of harmony in how you communicate. ",

I\u2019m looking for an absolute expert in podcast editing. Why? The mission of growing with me is to help to turn good leaders into great leaders through systems.\n\nThis means that we place value on other people\u2019s time above all else. My target audience is busy and overwhelmed business owners who have just entered the growth stage. This means they started their company with nothing but time and no money. But now they have seen financial success. So they have plenty of money but no time.\n\nThese people are in desperate need of our help. And the more of them we reach, the more we can help.\n\nHere\u2019s where you come in:\n\nI utilize LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube and email to connect with business owners to teach them systems and frameworks that will help them on their journey to grow the business without growing stress. For that, I need a world-class podcast editor to help me hold their attention to get the systems they need.\n\nThe main responsibilities of this position are as follows:\n\n1. Creating expert hooks (like Diary of A CEO) to engross the listener in what's to come in the first 90 seconds. This would be done by clipping the highlights from the episode and clipping them into cliffhangers with energetic music in the background.\n\n2. Creating show notes from all the available audio, resources provided by the guest, and more.\n\n3. Scheduling, posting, and syndicating the podcast to top channels like Spotify and Apple.\n\n4. Inserting mini-commercials for sponsors and rating requests at strategic parts of each episode.\n\nTo do this, you need to have:\n\n1. An elite understanding and wielding ability of the English language\n\n2. An upbeat attitude, always looking to be helpful and providing value\n\n3. 100% honesty and transparency. We care about improving, not perfection.\n\n4. Attention to detail. For instance, you\u2019ll give me your coffee order for me to review your application.\n\n5. Advanced understanding of podcast mixing software\n\n6. Advanced understanding of hooks + viral techniques\n\nWhat I value about all else:\n\n- Timeliness\n- Honesty\n- Desire to improve every day\n- Someone who asks questions\n- Someone who can follow step-by-step instructions with ease\n- A self-starter. You\u2019re fearless when it comes to improving and helping.\n\nYour work schedule will be:\n\nThis position is for 5 hours per week (more available). Hours are flexible. My expectation is not on when you work but when you turn projects around.\n\nI observe the following holidays:\n\n- New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day\n- Fourth of July\n- Labor Day\n- Thanksgiving Day and the day after\n- Christmas Eve and Christmas Day\n\nYou will have 1 vacation day upon one month of working together. After 6 months of working together, you get another 2. These vacation days will need to be requested in advance by 2 weeks. If we are still working together in 1 year, you will get 8 vacation days to start the year.\n\nWhy would you work with me versus someone else?\n\nThis position is not for a taskmaster. It is for someone who will be truly valued. You\u2019ll be on the ground floor of me building my audience to 100K+. I also have extensive experience in managing others. My full-time job is as a partner of a Top 100 digital marketing company in the USA. Each of my employees has a personalized roadmap to make sure they not only help the company but have 100% clarity on where they are headed, what they\u2019re working towards, and how much they\u2019ll make doing it.\n\nI had terrible bosses in my younger years. I\u2019ve spent my management career doing the opposite. Each of my employees has told me I\u2019m the best boss they\u2019ve had. I include that statement only to show you that your career will be highly valued. Your mission will not only be to make me better. We\u2019ll make each other better.\n\nI look forward to working with you! ",

    "description": "\nBackground\nThe Reliability Academy delivers world-class online training to clients and students across the globe. To date, we have helped 100+ companies, and trained 1000+ industry professionals, across 50+ countries in all major industries. Founded in 2018, we are headquartered in Brisbane, Australia but work virtually with most of our team based in the Philippines.\n\n\nAbout Us\nOur customers are in all parts of the world, from individuals to large multinational companies. We have big plans and are working to deliver our online training in 8-10 different languages to better serve our customers. We believe in being a force for good and that means:\n\n- building a great company with a strong focus on our values and behaviours. We are building a small, but mighty team that truly enjoys working together and delivers a world-class product and experience to our customers.\n\n- serving our niche to the best of our ability and reaching those less fortunate than us. To that purpose, we have launched the Road to Reliability\u2122 Scholarship program enabling students in developing nations to access our training with a 75% Scholarship\naligning our company mission and vision to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe company is growing with a small team of full-time and part-time contractors working across the Asia-Pacific region, currently all reporting to the Operations Manager, also based in the Philippines whilst our Managing Director is based in Brisbane, Australia. We deliberately hire talent in different regions of the world to keep costs down, create diversity, and build a multi-lingual team.\n\n\nRole Purpose\nThis role is responsible for enrolling new students, reporting student progress, providing fast and effective customer support, updating and maintaining all course content in the Reliability Academy, and acting as a first point of call for minor website corrections and improvements. This role will likely take over data management in our CRM and email automation platform (currently ActiveCampaign, but likely to be Hubspot in the future) and provide administrative support to our Managing Director and Operations Manager.\n\n\nResponsibilities\nAs our Virtual Assistant, your responsibilities will consist of:\n- Enrolling new students, sending welcome emails, and generating client progress reports.\n- Responding to all incoming support requests within 24 hours.\n- Ensuring that all related forms of automated communication (welcome email, password reset, etc.) are working properly.\n- Maintaining student data quality and completeness.\n- Completing minor website edits and updates as directed by other members of the team or through proactive reviewing our websites regularly.\n- Developing and maintaining SOPs relating to student management, enrollment, and website maintenance.\n- Setting up new courses in the Reliability Academy learning management system.\n- Quality checking (as required) of written content, PDFs, videos, graphics, and audio for quality issues.\n- Act as administrator for our CRM (Hubspot in future)\n- Generate and maintain business performance reports\n- Act as administrator for Microsoft Office 365.\n- Implement Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) recommendations as advised by our SEO consultants\n\n\nWhat Success Looks Like\nSucceeding in this role will mean all external communication will have engagement from anyone from the team within an acceptable turn-around time. Students and clients will feel that they are well taken care of, and this will result in a better customer experience. The success of this role will be measured by the following metrics:\n- All correspondence from clients, students, and vendors in our shared email inboxes is responded to within 24 hours.\n- Quality and efficient support is given to all stakeholders for credential creation, report generation, and other admin tasks.\n- Development and maintenance of SOPs relating to student management, enrollment, and website maintenance.\n- Exceed expectations in terms of customer experience.\n\n\nAbout You\nKnowledge and skills are important, but we will primarily hire based on attitude and behaviour, which means:\n- You are honest, reliable, and have a great attitude to work. You do what you say and say what you do.\n- You are highly organised, pay attention to detail, and get things right the first time most of the time, but are not afraid to make a mistake and take responsibility.\n- You take initiative, can work with relatively little supervision, and can manage a large diverse workload with competing priorities. You speak up when you don\u2019t know something or don\u2019t understand but are proactive enough to then go and find out and learn.\n- You have the ability to learn, document, and maintain processes and Standard Operation procedures (SOPs) while working in a fast-paced environment.\n- You can work well on your own but enjoy being part of a (virtual) team. You have no problem receiving feedback from others and acting on it.\n- You are keen to take on extra responsibilities where you can (after all you are a talented individual!) but at the same time, you are happy to do simple, more administrative work where required.\n- Ultimately you are the kind of individual who can make things happen and is excited by being part of a bigger vision.\n\n\nYour Skills\n- You have excellent customer service skills and communicate well with internal and external stakeholders.\n- You have excellent skills with Microsoft Office applications and ideally can act as an administrator for Microsoft Office 365.\n- You have strong skills in WordPress and our main plugins (LearnDash, BuddyBoss, MemberPress) and independently resolve minor issues and escalate as required to our Senior Developer\n- You are fluent in English and especially your written English is clear, concise, and accurate.\n- Speaking one of our target languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Arabic) would be a bonus\n\n\nWhat\u2019s on Offer\nThis is a long-term full-time (40 hours per week) remote contract role allowing you to work from home. You will work during Australian business hours i.e. your workday will fall between 7 am to 7 pm GMT+10 to ensure overlap with the rest of the team. There will be a 3-month probation period.\n\nBase pay up to USD 1,000 per month depending on experience and skills, with a 13th-month pay in December, 20 days of leave, an annual allowance of USD 1,000 towards Private Health Insurance and a chance to earn a performance bonus up to 3 months of salary (subject to business and personal performance).\n\n\nApplying\nIf you are interested then please complete the online application (see link below) summarising your background, your experience, and what makes you an excellent candidate for the role.

Our business is online (e-commerce) and we only sell information products (online trainings) for cancer patients to help them recover from treatments faster.

What I'm looking for is someone I can hand off all the tax prep and filing, quarterly payments, payroll taxes, and bookkeeping to, as well as set up and manage payroll for us (we do not have this setup just yet). Right now the majority of our bookkeeping (95%) is automatically done by QuickBooks automation as we run a very simple, online business, so this would not require much time in terms of weekly bookkeeping (maybe a couple hours per week honestly). \n\nThis would be a part-time position but one that we would like to hire for the long-term. And we are currently scaling our business so as it grows we would want to hire you for more work as needed. \n\nWe are very easy and fun guys to work for. We are a Christian company and already hire from the Philippines. So, if you think you would be interested in this position, please respond back with the words \"Rapid Remission\" in the title. Also, please tell us how many hours a week you estimate you would need to do this job. This number can always be negotiated, we would just like to get an estimate. Thanks so much! ",

This is a gig where you will work as needed on design projects that we receive from our clients. This is a great fit if you have a bit of extra time during the week to fit in some additional design projects. Some weeks we may not have any projects, while other weeks we may have a handful of new projects. You just track your time that you spend on the projects and invoice us for them once complete.\n\nWe typically have a few requests per week for designs in the following:\n- Website Design Mock-Ups\n- New Page Mock-Ups for Existing Websites (to match the look and feel of existing branding)\n- Email Newsletter Mock-Ups\n- Website Banners and Advertising Banners for Car Dealerships\n- Logo Designs\n- Social Media Graphics\n\nRequired Skills:\n- Create and update website designs using design tools such as PenPot, XD, or Figma\n- Ability to turn projects around quickly and be responsive to revision requests (within the next business day or two business days depending on the complexity of the ticket) is required, and without much initial information from the client. \nA great example is a client asking for a mock-up of a new page they want on their website but only giving a very vague description of what they want. You should take that initial information, look at their website and find your own inspiration resources to create a polished product to share with the client. We can then make revisions. As we all know, clients usually don't know what they want until they see what they DON'T want.\n- Clear communication for when you are starting work on a project, providing status updates as you work, and providing clear estimates on when each outstanding project should be ready so that we can keep the client in the loop. We value open and direct communication since this prevents 99% of issues that clients have when they don't know what to expect for timelines and results.\n\nHow the Process Works:\n- We will give you access to our ticketing system and design resources\n- You will be notified via email through this ticketing system when a new design ticket requires your assistance\n- You click to view the details of the ticket, add a note to the ticket to let our team know that you have reviewed the ticket, as well as if there is any other information you need, your estimated time to have the initial product ready to share\n- Run the time tracker and work on the project until finished\n- Add your time to the ticket\n- Leave a note on the ticket with links to your product, as well as the working files (e.g., .PSD, .AI) so that our team can quickly make revisions if needed prior to sharing with client\n- Send an invoice for your total time spent on projects every two weeks (the 1st and 15th of the month)\n\nIN YOUR REPLY, YOU MUST INCLUDE THE BELOW TO BE CONSIDERED\n- Your desired hourly rate in Php\n- Your desired payment method (Paypal, Wise, or Payoneer). We pay every two weeks and you can invoice us\n- Your Availability (Be specific with when you are available to respond and work on our projects if we have a new request come in)\n- Include examples of your designs ",

There are more than enough sites that need to be built and customize. There are a few requirements that will be crucial to making sure you are a good fit for this role.\n\nAll sites will be built with Elementor (Pro) and (occasionally) Gutenberg. I do not use WP Bakery / Visual Composer, Divi, Avada, Enfold, or any of the other pre-packaged themes that are out there. If you aren\u2019t an expert with Elementor, do not apply. Just to see if you are reading this posting completely when you apply, make the title of the email \"Blue\". If you don\u2019t do this, I will know that you don\u2019t pay attention to details and will not be considered at all for the job. Also, I am looking to build my team in the Philippines. If you are not located in the Philippines, please do not apply.\n\nYou must know PHP at an expert level. I will need custom work developed, custom plugins made, and layouts created in order to have the best functionality.\n\nJavascript/jquery (or any script variant) should be very natural to you. I know Wordpress uses a lot of it, so we need to manually manipulate it to work to our advantage.\n\nYou should know CSS at a very high level as well.\n\nPlease understand how to use MySQL or MariaDB. If there are custom work that needs to be done, I want to ensure there is no excessive database load. I can always create another space for a DB, but I need you to know when that needs to happen.\n\nThe ability to design clean sites is a bonus, but often there will be a style that you will be given to design to. I would like someone who understands how to make clean design if there are changes that should not have to wait for the designer.\nI would like you to rate the following as your expertise in your email. This is on a 1-10 scale (10 being the best)\n\nPHP \u2013\nCSS \u2013\nJS \u2013\nHTML \u2013\nDesign -\nAttention to Detail -\n\nPlease note, I have hired on this platform before and have found some great people. This is for full time and long term work. The pay will be $6 USD per hour, all work is tracked.\n\nIf you are interested in this position, please reply with your skills and a few example sites you have built. There is also a test to see if you know your stuff. This is an unpaid test and you will simply be recreating a page from a current design to see your speed and design. If you can make any SEO or page/site/speed improvement recommendations, that will put you at the top of the list.\n\nI would prefer it if you worked on California time, Monday through Friday, from 8:30am-5pm. I pay twice a month, typically via Wise, on the 1st and 16th of the month. The Pay on the 16th covers the time from the 1st-15th, and the pay on the 1st covers the pay from the 16th-End of month. All time tracking is based on the California Time.\n\nIf you are interested in the position and have read the entire post, please email me directly at Upgrade to see actual info to get started.

Don't get me wrong, you'll have all the support in the world from us, but we need someone who can \"own\" things and come up with creative solutions and carry things across the finish line.\n\nStrong Marketing Understanding - When you build a chat bot, or a web page, you must not only understand the instruction, but understand the reason \"why\" you are doing what you do, and be able to explain it to customers. We'll teach you and help you grow, but you must be able to think past what the task is, and understand the reason behind it.\n\n\n\nCandidates with the following attributes will be given special attention:\n\nManyChat Experience - Any prior experience with the platform ManyChat will give you a MASSIVE edge in applying for this position.
