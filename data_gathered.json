Personally I think that treating people like this no matter who they are is not only ethically wrong, but is also foolish. I have always treated my employees with the utmost levels of understanding, and respect. And in turn (in most cases), they treat me the same and also do amazing work. This leads to us both enjoying our day to day lives, loving the fact that we are growing something that changes the lives of our customers, and of course we both earn significantly so we can live the lives we should be.\n\r\nIf you end up working for us, you will quickly realize just how serious I am about all of this. Because at the end of the day its the people like yourself that make a company successful, and is exactly why when you choose who you want to work for, I think you should strongly consider us or others with similar values.\n\r\nAnd to put you at ease, I understand some of you are better at English than others. What is most important is that we are able to communicate over slack. \n\r\nI can\u2019t wait to meet you! \n\r\n- Blake\n\n\r\nTO APPLY FOR THIS JOB:\r\nComplete this form https://forms.gle/1vdRhvcf4HsP5xbW7\n\r\nWe will not reply to direct messages that have not completed the form.

Some days may involve just a few calls (around 3), other days none, and occasionally more than five. However, we are a growing business so this will eventually increase. Unlike a typical BPO setting, this position does not have call quotas or strict average handle time (AHT) requirements. The focus is simply on supporting guests as needed, and you\u2019ll be able to answer calls directly through an app on your phone.)\r\nTrack cash reservations, process payments, and manage guest reviews on Airbnb and Booking.com.

    "description": "\n                    Are you an experienced designer with a knack for creating beautiful and effective designs for websites and other graphics? This is a gig where you will work as needed on design projects that we receive from our clients. This is a great fit if you have a bit of extra time during the week to fit in some additional design projects. Some weeks we may not have any projects, while other weeks we may have a handful of new projects. You just track your time that you spend on the projects and invoice us for them once complete.\n\r\nWe typically have a few requests per week for designs in the following:\r\n- Website Design Mock-Ups\r\n- New Page Mock-Ups for Existing Websites (to match the look and feel of existing branding)\r\n- Email Newsletter Mock-Ups\r\n- Website Banners and Advertising Banners for Car Dealerships\r\n- Logo Designs\r\n- Social Media Graphics\n\r\nRequired Skills:\r\n- Create and update website designs using design tools such as PenPot, XD, or Figma\r\n- Ability to turn projects around quickly and be responsive to revision requests (within the next business day or two business days depending on the complexity of the ticket) is required, and without much initial information from the client. \r\nA great example is a client asking for a mock-up of a new page they want on their website but only giving a very vague description of what they want. You should take that initial information, look at their website and find your own inspiration resources to create a polished product to share with the client. We can then make revisions. As we all know, clients usually don't know what they want until they see what they DON'T want.\r\n- Clear communication for when you are starting work on a project, providing status updates as you work, and providing clear estimates on when each outstanding project should be ready so that we can keep the client in the loop. We value open and direct communication since this prevents 99% of issues that clients have when they don't know what to expect for timelines and results.\n\r\nHow the Process Works:\r\n- We will give you access to our ticketing system and design resources\r\n- You will be notified via email through this ticketing system when a new design ticket requires your assistance\r\n- You click to view the details of the ticket, add a note to the ticket to let our team know that you have reviewed the ticket, as well as if there is any other information you need, your estimated time to have the initial product ready to share\r\n- Run the time tracker and work on the project until finished\r\n- Add your time to the ticket\r\n- Leave a note on the ticket with links to your product, as well as the working files (e.g., .PSD, .AI) so that our team can quickly make revisions if needed prior to sharing with client\r\n- Send an invoice for your total time spent on projects every two weeks (the 1st and 15th of the month)\n\r\nIN YOUR REPLY, YOU MUST INCLUDE THE BELOW TO BE CONSIDERED\r\n- Your desired hourly rate in Php\r\n- Your desired payment method (Paypal, Wise, or Payoneer). We pay every two weeks and you can invoice us\r\n- Your Availability (Be specific with when you are available to respond and work on our projects if we have a new request come in)\r\n- Include examples of your designs                ",

I want you to help create segmented email funnels for my community and create better engagement, affiliate sales and drive traffic to my website using email marketing. \n\r\nI currently have a basic welcome sequence set up as a pop-up \"5 day free guide to plant-based living\" which you can preview here: https://glow-diaries.com/ but no real segmenting of the audience.\n\r\nI would need you to write daily emails to drive traffic to recipes and also to ghost write in my tone of voice, sharing personal updates behind the scenes in my life (we will communicate mostly on Slack so I can give you a quick voicenote of what to say in the email). \n\r\nYou will also develop segments for my audience and use polls to engage them and learn more about them. You will help craft a sales email funnel sequence (I already have one that needs to be updated) for a digital nutrition course I sell. You will also help me craft emails specifically geared towards affiliate marketing. \r\nThe role in future may expand to include responsibility for affiliate marketing in a broader scope - creating strategies across not just email but also my website links and social media.\n\r\nMy email list is about 44k, mostly USA, UK and Australian women who are interested in eating healthy plant based meals. Many of them are mothers. Majority are 25-44 but I also have a very engaged group of slightly older women who have adult children (I think I remind them of their own daughters) who are about 55-65.\n\r\nI also use ManyChat on social media and it would be a great bonus if you have experience creating funnels for that platform, as this will need to be integrated into the email strategy too (this is how I drive most of my traffic and email sign ups). \n\r\nThe interview process will consist of a small paid trial task and email interviews. Please include the subject line \"email foodie\" so I know you have read this application :) please also include a link to your resume, portfolio and any other relevant experience you may have.\n\r\nI estimate this role is part time however I am also looking for social media manager, so if you perform well in this role, I can expand the responsibilities for the right candidate. I believe to write 1 email daily, plus create the funnels and other automations, it is about 2 hours work per day or 14 hours / week. Salary is  $160 / month (about $2.90 / hour) but can increase this for the right candidate if you have Many Chat experience, social media management, keyword research or Wordpress skills. Let me know what you can do and your preferred number of daily hours :)                ",

    "description": "\n                    Are you passionate about Python and becoming the best developer you can become? Let\u2019s team up. \n\r\nWe believe in people. This is why we only work with clients who serve people. From firefighters, to law firms, to suppliers sending life-saving food to kids dying of malnutrition, the code you write will help make the world a better place.\n\r\nOur team is made up of people who want to do the best work of their life. People who love to learn, challenge themselves, grow and have some fun along the journey. We also care about each other \u2013 we support each other in our own personal goals and vision. We are human beings before employees and we love to bring out the best in each other. \n\r\nNow, ready to learn more about this opening? Buckle up.\n\r\nIf you work here, you\u2019ll be: \r\n- Challenged to do the best work of your life in a supportive environment.\r\n- Become the best communicator you can become (this is the most important thing we do).\r\n- Have the space to ask questions, voice your feedback and make a difference (and be yourself).\r\n- Help expand our codebase and tools, participate in code reviews, and grow with your fellow developers. \n\r\nYou\u2019ll do well in this job if you:\r\n- Have a strong background in Python and understand HTML, CSS and Javascript enough to be dangerous.\r\n- Enjoy working with people who actually care about what they do and will not let you be lazy or do sloppy work.\r\n- Have an opinion and care about best practices and love learning and creating and building. \r\n- Are familiar with common things we deal with as developers: Git, SQLAlchemy, building and engaging with APIs, linters, etc. \r\n- Have grit and determination and are someone who will exceed no matter what gets in your way.\r\n- Are attentive to details.\r\n- Have 3+ years of Python development experience. \n\r\nYou probably shouldn\u2019t apply if:\r\n- You\u2019re \u201cjust looking for extra money.\u201d\r\n- You like working 5 full-time jobs because all you care about is work. \r\n- You get offended easily and take things personally. \r\n- You are not someone with grit and determination who can persevere while being challenged to do great work.\r\n- You get overwhelmed easily with new code, new habits, new learnings and chat messages. \n\r\nThe interview process:\r\n- Since 99% of our work is done via Slack (we don\u2019t do scheduled calls), the entire interview process will be via email. (With lots of questions, sprinkled with a few voice notes)\r\n- You may be able to speak with a developer or two on our team to see how they like the role. \n\r\nIf you work here:\r\n- You\u2019ll get 13th month salary, Filipino holidays, unlimited time off (we don\u2019t count sick days), a normal working day schedule (no night shifts, although an early start is preferred for time overlap) with some flexibility, 2 weeks off during the holidays in December, and the opportunity to grow and become your best self. \n\r\nA little more about us:\r\n- We\u2019ve been in business for a decade+. Our teams are remote (mostly in the Philippines). Our longest standing team member has been with us for over 13+ years. We've had people quit smoking on our teams with our help, lose weight, learn a new instrument, speak a new language, and more. We all love what we do. \n\r\nHow to begin\r\n- Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to send us an email with 3 questions you have about this role. If you\u2019re currently in a full-time role and are looking for something new, we\u2019re open to a transition window. We actually care about your happiness.\n\r\nNOTE: While we like AI, and we use it in certain circumstances, we ask that no AI be used during communication. Communication is the most important thing we do. If I don't see your natural voice from our first interaction, then you're setting an inaccurate representation of who you are and how you communicate. And when I see that change, it's going to come across as a lack of harmony in how you communicate.                ",
