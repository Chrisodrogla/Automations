I will be reviewing your code and giving feedback. Note that I only work part time at this business.\n\nThe specific programming languages and technologies you are familiar with do not matter, you can learn other languages, however knowing these are beneficial:\n\n(in no particular order)\n(I don't use all of these, I just want to know if you know them)\n\n- C#\n- F#\n- WPF\n- Java\n- OCaml\n- Python 3\n- Golang\n- Rust\n- Docker\n- Kubernetes\n- Azure\n- AWS\n- SQL (which dialect?)\n- NoSQL systems (which?)\n- TypeScript\n- React\n- Redis\n- Kafka\n- Terraform\n- ChatGPT including its API, or similar\n- PyTorch\n- TensorFlow\n- Selenium\n\nAn understanding of the following is beneficial but absolutely not necessary, mention to me what you know about these:\n- Economics\n- Finance\n- Trading (stocks or otherwise)\n- Politics\n- Geopolitics\n- Prediction Markets\n- Psychology\n- Statistics\n- Calculus\n\nThis is a very early-stage business.

Due to the nature of the business, even building an MVP will take some time.\n\nThe project involves creating an analytics system for geopolitical analysis. The purpose of the analysis is to license it to financial firms to help them understand risk to their financial assets. The analysis uses OS INT techniques but the idea is to automate a significant chunk of the analysis, so that we can cover much more material with a small number of human analysts. It is a cloud-based system, using microservice architecture. ",

    "description": "\nThere are two areas I need expertise in. I have to build 8 new websites for products I have rights to distribute and sell. My servers run on Virtualmin and I have a part-time admin to help with server management. This requires starting from zero to fully functioning marketing websites. Some sites are very simple with one item to market (an airplane, for example) and the focus would be soliciting clients to request data and purchase. Other sites will be a product line of items for specific vendors. Some are inventories, some are dropped from the factory.\n\nThe new websites you will design and quickly implement will focus on aircraft and aviation products that I am involved with and parts connected with aircraft and aviation. I need a skilled WP/Elementor designer to help design, build, populate and update as the sites grow. The sites need to follow the vendor's guidelines for style, imagery, font and other guidelines. I will provide the marketing components while you design the site and operational details. We will need to collaborate up front and you will be expected to guide the project and I will help with any problems or decisions you have to make.\n\nClients need to be able to order, request quotes and pay. But many of these items are high value so credit cards are not the solution. Most clients use wires, ACH, checks and other cash-like transfers to avoid fees. Many items are high-priced, low volume so tracking leads and advertising are critical to reach the customers. \n\nYou should be able to improve my ability to deliver client quotes, obtain customer feedback, submit support inquiries and assist connecting with a CRM so we can track our leads and customers. Many of the products can be shared across multiple websites so catalog product management experience would be helpful but not required. A major part of the sales pitch is imagery and graphics designed to sell specific aircraft and aircraft-related products. I also have imagery from a major vendor and rights to sell products that need a professional dealer website, fast response to monthly product and price changes and ability for customers to interact, ask questions, get quotes, design and order different combinations of products, track inventory and more. I am doing that manually at this time so you have a chance to improve both our lives.\n\nI am based in Canada and most clients will be in North America and to a lesser extent Australia and Europe. Shipping and receiving is a major piece of my business that is growing. Some items are drop shipped. I have not explored any sales on ebay, Amazon and the products do not seem suited to social media marketing but I do advertise there to obtain mostly to funnel members to my websites.\n\nA secondary project is moving my 10-year community phpbb site to latest version (3.3). PHP/Mysql would be beneficial but not essential. I will need assistance to migrate special mods to the new \"extension\" methods. Skills in this area would be helpful but not required for the primary sites above.\n\nThis position has some immediate requirements for the right person and long-term employment potential. I run a very small team and I am very involved in the details but need to expand these new product lines and continue to upgrade the site that I currently maintain. A probationary period would be expected so we can see if we can work long-term together as a team. Salary is negotiable and tied to skills you have. ",
