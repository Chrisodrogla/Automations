To recreate the positive cultures from our past experiences, at IronKlad Group we have implemented numerous benefits that you can read more about in the \u2018perks\u2019 section of this job posting.\n\r\nSomething else I wanted to mention is that I have had too many interviews with Filipinos who shared horror stories about how other companies have treated them, and hope that this part of the job description puts you at ease. Personally I think that treating people like this no matter who they are is not only ethically wrong, but is also foolish. I have always treated my employees with the utmost levels of understanding, and respect. And in turn (in most cases), they treat me the same and also do amazing work. This leads to us both enjoying our day to day lives, loving the fact that we are growing something that changes the lives of our customers, and of course we both earn significantly so we can live the lives we should be.\n\r\nIf you end up working for us, you will quickly realize just how serious I am about all of this. Because at the end of the day its the people like yourself that make a company successful, and is exactly why when you choose who you want to work for, I think you should strongly consider us or others with similar values.\n\r\nAnd to put you at ease, I understand some of you are better at English than others. What is most important is that we are able to communicate over slack. \n\r\nI can\u2019t wait to meet you! \n\r\n- Blake\n\n\r\nTO APPLY FOR THIS JOB:\r\nComplete this form https://forms.gle/1vdRhvcf4HsP5xbW7\n\r\nWe will not reply to direct messages that have not completed the form.

This role includes handling calls from guests, though it\u2019s not a typical BPO or call center environment with call quotas. We treat our team members like real people, not robots! Calls usually involve guest inquiries or check-in details and sometimes handling check-in issues.  Handling these calls is part of the responsibility to ensure smooth guest experiences.

Some days may involve just a few calls (around 3), other days none, and occasionally more than five. However, we are a growing business so this will eventually increase. Unlike a typical BPO setting, this position does not have call quotas or strict average handle time (AHT) requirements. The focus is simply on supporting guests as needed, and you\u2019ll be able to answer calls directly through an app on your phone.)\r\nTrack cash reservations, process payments, and manage guest reviews on Airbnb and Booking.com.
