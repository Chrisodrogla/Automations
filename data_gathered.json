I will be reviewing your code and giving feedback. Note that I only work part time at this business.\n\nThe specific programming languages and technologies you are familiar with do not matter, you can learn other languages, however knowing these are beneficial:\n\n(in no particular order)\n(I don't use all of these, I just want to know if you know them)\n\n- C#\n- F#\n- WPF\n- Java\n- OCaml\n- Python 3\n- Golang\n- Rust\n- Docker\n- Kubernetes\n- Azure\n- AWS\n- SQL (which dialect?)\n- NoSQL systems (which?)\n- TypeScript\n- React\n- Redis\n- Kafka\n- Terraform\n- ChatGPT including its API, or similar\n- PyTorch\n- TensorFlow\n- Selenium\n\nAn understanding of the following is beneficial but absolutely not necessary, mention to me what you know about these:\n- Economics\n- Finance\n- Trading (stocks or otherwise)\n- Politics\n- Geopolitics\n- Prediction Markets\n- Psychology\n- Statistics\n- Calculus\n\nThis is a very early-stage business.

Due to the nature of the business, even building an MVP will take some time.\n\nThe project involves creating an analytics system for geopolitical analysis. The purpose of the analysis is to license it to financial firms to help them understand risk to their financial assets. The analysis uses OS INT techniques but the idea is to automate a significant chunk of the analysis, so that we can cover much more material with a small number of human analysts. It is a cloud-based system, using microservice architecture. ",
